WE BE DOIN DIS FAGGOT

THINGS TO DO:

1) Buy raspi
2) Choose OS
    decent options:
        -ARCH       -ARCH
        -ARCH       -ARCH
        -ARCH       -ARCH
        -ARCH       -ARCH
        -ARCH       -ARCH
3) CODE STUFF
4) DEBUG

OK BUT FOR REALZ:

* get raspi doc
* get ultrasonic sound doc
* create concept
* think about communication implementation
    - UDP connect to server
        - evaluate sensor data on pi or on server??
        - server calculate positional matrix
        - make it for generic number of clients...
        - maybe even automatic client log on log off recognition?
* POC
